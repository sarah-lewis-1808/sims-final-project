As part of our Dev Academy final project we were tasked with creating an app in the space of a week to simulate an industry sprint working in a small team. 

This game is a web based app that takes an initial caption written by the first player, and this is then drawn by the next player, and the process repeats in the same manner building off the last caption of the previous drawing.
