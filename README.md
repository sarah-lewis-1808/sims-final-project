A multiplayer collaborative drawing game in the sytle of Windows98

by Sarah Lewis, Ian Chua, Milo Palmer & Sparrow Peppermint

Background
In the final week of my Dev Academy Aotearoa studies we all pitched project ideas as a group of 25. We then voted for our favourite ideas and were put into small teams of 4-5 and assigned one of the projects to execute in our small team. 

The Original Pitch
The original pitch we were assigned was a game similar to whispers where someone starts with a sentence and whispers that sentence to the next person, who then repeats what they heard to the next person, and so on. This project idea involved an initial prompt sentence by the first player and then the next person was required to draw that prompt.

Technologies Used
Node.js, React, Typescript, Tailwind

Planning, Executing and Presenting 
We planned the project using a Notion board that we all had access to, which can be viewed here...

We all agreed that the most important part of executing a successful project in a week was effective planning, so we spent 2 full days making wireframes and researching technologies, discussing ideas and making sure we all understood what the requirements were and how we were going to execute them.
